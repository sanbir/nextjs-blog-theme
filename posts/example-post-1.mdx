A style guide for a website is a set of design standards that define the look, feel, and behavior of a digital product, ensuring consistency and cohesion across all pages and elements. It typically includes guidelines for colors, typography, spacing, buttons, icons, and imagery, as well as instructions on voice and tone for content.
